This document specifies E85, a format for representing binary data as printable text. E85 is an extension of Z85 encoding mechanisms, modified to provide byte-accurate binary stream wrapping.

# Problem Statement

When representing binary values in code and in text files (such as configuration data), the developer must choose a printable representation. The simplest choice is Base16, where each byte is printed as two hexadecimal values.

For better efficiency than Base16, the developer might choose Base64. This is a common choice but problematic because it has more than a dozen variants. It works poorly with binary data since it works on three-byte chunks, whereas most binary data is chunked to 4 or 8 bytes. Base64 implementations are therefore more complex than they might be, and not necessarily interoperable.
Å“
A more logical encoding is Z85, which works on 4-byte chunks. It is string-safe, so can be used cleanly in source code, XML, JSON, and so on.

However, Z85 does not enable byte-accurate binary stream transport, because the binary frame SHALL have a length divisible by 4.

Our ideal encoding is designed for 4-byte chunks like Z85, but is able to handle binary frames of non divisible-by-4 length. To achieve this, E85 implements an erasure mechanism similar to base64.

An E85 implementation is able to natively decode a Z85 string frame.

# Formal Specification

An E85 implementation takes a binary frame and encodes it as a printable ASCII string, or takes an ASCII encoded string and decodes it into a binary frame.

The erasure character is defined as the character which value equals 0x5F. It SHALL be placed at the end of a string frame. The erasure character SHALL NOT be repeated more than 3 times.

The binary frame SHALL have any length. If the binary frame length is not divisible by 4 with no remainder, an E85 implementation SHALL zero-pad the binary frame to generate a valid Z85 binary frame, and SHALL append the erasure character as many times as it added zero-padding bytes.

The string frame, excluding the erasure characters, SHALL have a length that is divisible by 5 with no remainder.

The encoding and decoding SHALL use this representation for each base-85 value from zero to 84:

 0 -  9:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 - 19:  a b c d e f g h i j
20 - 29:  k l m n o p q r s t
30 - 39:  u v w x y z A B C D
40 - 49:  E F G H I J K L M N
50 - 59:  O P Q R S T U V W X
60 - 69:  Y Z . - : + = ^ ! /
70 - 79:  * ? & < > ( ) [ ] {
80 - 84:  } @ % $ #

To encode a frame, an implementation SHALL take four octets at a time from the binary frame and convert them into five printable characters. The four octets SHALL be treated as an unsigned 32-bit integer in network byte order (big endian). The five characters SHALL be output from most significant to least significant (big endian).

To decode a string, an implementation SHALL take five characters at a time from the string and convert them into four octets of data representing a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order. The five characters SHALL each be converted into a value 0 to 84, and accumulated by multiplication by 85, from most to least significant.

# Test Case

As a test case, a frame containing these 9 bytes:

+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
| 0x86 | 0x4F | 0xD2 | 0x6F | 0xB5 | 0x59 | 0xF7 | 0x5B | 0x00 |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

SHALL encode as the following 18 characters:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| H | e | l | l | o | W | o | r | l | d | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | _ | _ | _ |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation in C is provided in the repository at https://github.com/ggramaize/libz85/

# Security Considerations

Implementations MUST take care that buffers intended to receive encoded and decoded data are large enough. Clearly, a properly-crafted encoded string can create any arbitrary binary sequence, which makes E85 an easy vector for attack into a badly-designed implementation.
